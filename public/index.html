            <h2>The test webshop</h2>
            <p>
                The webshop we're using is made by OWASP. All exercises can be solved without access to the source code, but it can make your life easier. You can find the source code here: <a href="https://github.com/juice-shop/juice-shop">https://github.com/juice-shop/juice-shop</a>
            </p>
            <div class="button_primary">
                <a href="/" onclick="javascript:event.target.port=3000">Open test webshop</a>
            </div>
            <p>
                Or, navigate to <code>http://juice-shop.local:3000</code>
            </p>
